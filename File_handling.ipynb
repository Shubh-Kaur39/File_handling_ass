        "- Interpreted language converts high level language to machine language line by line but compiled languages convert a high level code to machine code at once. A program written in an interpreted language is iterpreted whereas the code of compiled languages can be executed directly by the CPU of the computer. Interpreted code can be modified while the program is running but is a bit slow. In contrast, compiled code runs faster then the interpreted code. Examples of interpreted languages are python, java, C# and examples of compiled languages are C, Fortran, and COBOL.\n",

Since, there are multiple processors in multiprocessing, each process has its own memory space and resources which are isolated from other processes. In contrast, we know multithreading happens on single processor so, thread share same memory space and resources within the process.

        "- Logging module is a python module used to track events while the program is running. Logging is a record of the state and flow of your program/ code/ software. It helps to track all the events that occur while the program is running. It is useful for understanding, monitoring, and debugging of your code. We can use logging to record information about errors, warnings and other events that occur during program execution.\n",

        "- os module is a built-in python module by which we can interact with os. We can work with files, folders, paths and os environment by importing os module. Some commands in os modules are listed below:\n",
        "1. `os.getcwd()` -> to get current working directory\n",
        "2. `os.path.getsize('file.txt')` -> To get size of the file\n",

        "-\n",
        "1. Program runtimes are slower as sometimes the program holds freed memory in the interpreter rather than freeing up for os.\n",
        "2. Python keeps objects in the memory until all the references are gone so it is difficult to handle in large datasets.\n",
        "3. Python takes more time to deallocate memory especially in circular references.\n",

It is important in tasks that are part of same application and need to share data/resources. Example: in input/output process like downloading the file, reading/writing in a file. It can also be used in GUI apps like games because it make applications responsive by running background tasks with the main tasks.\n",
